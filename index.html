        <h1>The Ghost at John Tree Hill</h1>

        <p>Stories from My Grandmother: The Ghost at John Tree Hill</p>
        <p>By Catherine Amos, Richmond/The Fan</p>
        <p>You know that nursery rhyme, “Over the river and through the woods, to grandmother’s house we go…”? I always thought it was written about my grandmother. My mom’s mother, Pauline Mitchell, lives over the James River and through some (now thinning) woods west of Rt. 288 in Powhatan. She and my grandfather, Ashton “Mitch” Mitchell, raised their six children in a three-story white house at the end of a county road flanked by horse pastures. The river runs behind it at the bottom of a steep hill where, as kids, we would chase each other and try to avoid ticks.</p>
        <p>My grandparents bought John Tree Hill in 1961 — or 1962, depending on which of their children you ask — and when I was growing up, I always knew about the ghost. My uncles told me stories about growing up on the third floor, stories of someone watching them sleep or sitting on the corner of their bed. I never actually saw a ghost, but my cousins and I treated it like a pet. We tried to play games with it, leaving treasures out for it to move or hide. For a long time we assumed the ghost was John, the man we were told was hanged on the property during the Civil War (hence the name John Tree Hill). Despite outgrowing some of the stories, I’ve always believed in the ghost. </p>
        <p>Recently, I asked Grandma to tell me about her first encounter with him.</p>
        <p>“It was hot — mid July 1961,” she said. “The power had not been turned on. We were coming out to the house to do some work; we hadn’t moved in yet. After we’d been here a couple of hours working, everyone was getting a little hungry, thirsty. My husband said he would take the children up to the local country store and get some snacks and soft drinks. He left me at home with a six-month-old baby in a playpen sound asleep. So I stayed here. The house was totally empty. </p>
        <p>“I was so hot, so I stretched out on the hardwood floor because it was cooler. I sort of dozed off and all of a sudden I woke up because I thought I heard someone say, ‘Hello.’ And it was a welcoming hello. It wasn’t a surprise; it was like, ‘Hello, what took you so long to get here?’ I got up and went to the front door and there was no one there, no car. I checked the side door and the back door — there are a lot of doors. Nobody. But that person said hello, and they were welcoming me. After that, anytime someone mentioned the ghosts at John Tree Hill, it didn’t bother me a bit because they were happy to see me. They were friendly ghosts.”</p>
        <p>Her neighbors had heard stories about a ghost, but my grandmother didn’t know anything until she heard that voice. “I didn’t think it was a ghost,” she said casually. “I didn’t know what it was. Once we moved in, people started talking to me about the ghost. Wanting to know if I’d seen it.” She hadn’t, and she never had another encounter after that, but on a whim one night seven years later she invited a psychic to come to the house. </p>
        <p>“I was taking a night class at VCU. I was talking to some other students, and I asked these two young men what they did. One said that he was a psychic and that he could read houses. I asked him what that meant, and he said, ‘Well, if people have spirits or ghosts or feel a house is haunted, I go check it out.’ I said, ‘Oh, people say my house is haunted.’ He asked if he could come read it, and I said sure. I started to tell him about it, and he said, ‘No, I don’t want to know anything. Can I come out tomorrow night?’</p>
        <p>“So the next night, it was a cold, windy night, and we had a big fire in the fireplace. My husband was in New York on a business trip, and these two young men came — I didn’t know them. One was in some of my journalism classes but I didn’t know him. All of a sudden I thought, ‘This is really weird. Here you are with these two young men that you don’t know.’ So I said to my six children, ‘You can stay up in the living room with me while they’re here.’</p>
        <p>“The psychic walked through the house. He said, ‘Where in the house do you get a feeling?’ I said, ‘My son Danny is on the third floor and he keeps thinking there’s something in his room, sitting on the edge of the bed and looking at him. He feels like it’s some sort of a religious person.’</p>
        <p>“So he walked around outside, too, and at that time we had two formal gardens out here with hedges and flowers. In the middle of it I had a statue of a little girl. We had a pet pig named Percy, and Percy would run loose and scratch his back on the statue and knock it over. He chipped it, and so I moved the statue so it wouldn’t fall. [The psychic] walked all around and he came back inside and he asked, ‘Why isn’t the statue in the middle of the garden?’ I told him about the pig. </p>
        <p>“He said, ‘I’m getting vibes from two different spirits. One is a very religious man who walks around the edge of the cliff [at the river] and he loves to sit and read his Bible. He’s like an itinerant preacher and wears a buckskin jacket with some fringe. He loves to sit and read the Bible. He’s very benign. But the house ghost is a different one. He’s also a friendly spirit, and also religious. They are totally unrelated, from different eras.’”</p>
        <p>Grandma stopped her story and said, “What really got me was when he wanted to know about the statue.” She had never seen a man in a buckskin jacket, but a few days after the reading, she had an interesting conversation with a neighbor, the daughter of John Tree Hill’s original owner. </p>
        <p>“My daughter Susan was going on a school trip and I had to pick up her friend at a neighboring house early in the morning. Her friend lived with her grandmother, a woman who grew up at John Tree Hill and whose parents built the house. We had coffee, and I told her about the readers. She said, ‘Did he say anything about the man in the buckskin jacket?’ As a matter of fact he did. She said, ‘We used to sit in rocking chairs on the back porch, and often at twilight, he would walk along the cliff. He was very courtly and gentlemanly, and he would carry his Bible and he would doff his hat and walk on.’ </p>
        <p>“And I said, ‘Oh my lord that’s just what they told me.’”</p>
        <p>Catherine has spent nearly every Thanksgiving at John Tree Hill and is getting married there in October. She has never seen the ghost, but her grandfather did try to trick her as a child with a white sheet hanging from the third floor window. </p>
